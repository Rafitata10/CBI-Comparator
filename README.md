## Fail Tolerant DualNano - CBI-Comparator

This project is developed by Rafael Ramírez Salas as part of his final year project at the University of Málaga, Computer Engineering department. The project is titled "Fail Tolerant DualNano".

## Overview

This project is a comparator system written in C++. It compares two sets of data and executes commands based on the comparison results. It's designed to work with a state machine and a screen for output. It also interacts with hardware through digital writes.

## Features

- `Data comparison`: The system compares two sets of data and executes commands based on the comparison.

- `State machine interaction`: The system interacts with a state machine to execute commands.

- `Screen output`: The system outputs the results of the commands to a screen.

- `Hardware interaction`: The system interacts with hardware through digital writes.

## Setup

To set up the project, you need to have the Arduino IDE installed on your system. Then, download the project files and open them in the Arduino IDE. Make sure to install the necessary libraries mentioned above. You can use VS Code with PlatformIO extension as well.

## Environment Setup

This project is developed for the Arduino Uno platform using the Atmel AVR microcontrollers. The code is written in the Arduino framework.

The project is configured with the PlatformIO IDE. The configuration is specified in the `platformio.ini` file.

## Usage

Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. The system should start running immediately after the upload is complete. You can use VS Code with PlatformIO extension as well.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before making a change.
